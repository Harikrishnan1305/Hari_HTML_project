        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an <em>2027</em> upcoming American superhero
        film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers. Produced by
        Marvel Studios and AGBO, and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion
        Pictures, it is intended to be the sequel to Avengers: Endgame (2019)
        and the 39th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by
        Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Michael Waldron and Stephen
        McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Chris Hemsworth,
        Vanessa Kirby, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Letitia Wright, Paul
        Rudd, Wyatt Russell, Tenoch Huerta Mejía, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Simu Liu,
        Florence Pugh, Kelsey Grammer, Lewis Pullman, Danny Ramirez, Joseph
        Quinn, David Harbour, Winston Duke, Hannah John-Kamen, Tom Hiddleston,
        Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Alan Cumming, Rebecca Romijn, James
        Marsden, Channing Tatum, Pedro Pascal, and Robert Downey Jr. In the
        film, the Avengers, Wakandans, Fantastic Four, New Avengers, and the
        X-Men team up to face Doctor Doom (Downey). Two new Avengers films, The
        Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars, were announced in July 2022 as the
        conclusion of the MCU's Phase Six and "The Multiverse Saga". Destin
        Daniel Cretton was hired to direct The Kang Dynasty and Jonathan Majors
        was set to reprise his MCU role as the villain Kang the Conqueror. Jeff
        Loveness joined the film as writer that September. In November 2023,
        Cretton departed, Waldron replaced Loveness as writer, and Marvel was
        considering moving away from the Kang storyline, in part due to Majors's
        legal issues; Majors was fired the following month. The return of the
        Russo brothers as directors and McFeely as co-writer, the casting of
        Downey as new villain Doctor Doom, and the new subtitle Doomsday were
        all announced in July 2024. Filming began in April 2025 at Pinewood
        Studios in England, with a large cast consisting mainly of actors from
        previous MCU media and 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series, and wrapped
        in September. Location filming took place in England and Bahrain.
        Avengers: Doomsday is scheduled to be released in the United States on
        December 18, 2026, as part of Phase Six of the MCU. The sequel,
        Avengers: Secret Wars, is set to be released on December 17, 2027.

        <strong>Money Heist</strong> (Spanish: La casa de papel, [la ˈkasa ðe paˈpel], lit. 'The
        House of Paper') is a Spanish heist crime drama television series
        created by Álex Pina. The series traces two long-prepared heists led by
        the Professor (Álvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on
        the Bank of Spain, told from the perspective of one of the robbers,
        Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó). The story is told in a real-time-like fashion
        and relies on an unreliable narrator, flashbacks, time-jumps, and hidden
        character motivations for complexity.[2][3][4] The series was initially
        intended as a two-part limited series. It had its original run of 15
        episodes on Spanish network Antena 3 from 2 May 2017 through 23 November
        2017. Netflix acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut
        the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide,
        beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the
        second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series
        with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3,
        with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with
        eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving
        the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled
        Money Heist: The Phenomenon (Spanish: La casa de papel: El Fenómeno). In
        July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part, which
        was released in two five-episode volumes, on 3 September and 3 December
        2021, respectively.
